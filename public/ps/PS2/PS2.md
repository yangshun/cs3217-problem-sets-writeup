Section 1 - Introduction
--
This assignment consists of two parts. In the first part of this as- signment, you will be introduced to Xcode, which is the IDE for Mac OS and iOS development. In the second part, you will take the opportunity to learn the basics of the Objective-C program- ming language and create a simple command line tool using Xcode.

### Subsection 1 ###

Xcode is already installed on the iMacs in Programming Lab 1, so there is no need for you to install Xcode if you work in the lab. If you plan to work on this assignment and subsequent assignments on your own iMac or Macbook, you will have to install Xcode yourself. If so, we will leave you to figure out how to download and install Xcode.

This weekâ€™s assignment has two parts. The goal of the first part of the assignment is to create your first iPad application, HelloIPad. You do not have to worry, because you will be given detailed step-by-step instruc- tions for this first assignment.

As the weeks go by, you will be required to be increasingly independent and figure out more things for your- self. Part of the learning experience is to learn how to figure things out even if you are not told explicitly what to do.

In the second part of this assignment, the goal is to get used to programming Objective-C. For this part, your goal is to develop a Mac command line tool. During this part, you will have to remember the C programming language (or learn C really quickly) and augment your knowledge with Objective-C syntax, constructs, and base classes.
