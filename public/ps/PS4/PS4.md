Section 1 - Introduction
--
This assignment consists of two parts. In the first part of this as- signment, you will be introduced to Xcode, which is the IDE for Mac OS and iOS development. In the second part, you will take the opportunity to learn the basics of the Objective-C program- ming language and create a simple command line tool using Xcode.

Timing, Motion, Collision, Animation

Section 4 - Grading and Submission
--
Please read this section carefully so that you fully understand the grading scheme and the mode of submission!

### Grading Scheme ###

In this module, you are being trained to become a good software engineer. The first and basic requirement is that your code must satisfy the requirements and be correct. Above and beyond correctness, you are required to write well-documented code.

For this problem set, we will be testing your code by compiling your app and uploading it to an iPad to make sure that the game works as expected. We will be looking at the following:

- Your submission should adhere to the submission format.
- You have answered the questions satisfactorily in a concise manner.
- Your project should build without errors or warnings.
- Your project should run without crashing.
- You have implemented extra features.
- Your game engine works. By this, we mean that the bubbles interact with each other and exhibit the desired behaviours.

### Mode of Submission ###

The teaching staff will be grading your code directly on GitHub. You will be graded on the latest commit on the master branch before the deadline. Your solution for this Problem Set should be contained in a single directory called `ps04`, which should be inside the root directory of the private repository
assigned to you. The `ps04` directory should contain all your project files. However, in order to keep the size of your submission small, you should omit the build subdirectory that contains the compiled binaries. In addition, your submission directory should contain your design explanation design.txt, a module dependency diagram `MDD.png` and a `README` file where you specify which implementation files contain your code.
