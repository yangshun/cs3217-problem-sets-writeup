Section 1 - Introduction
--
This assignment consists of two parts. In the first part of this assignment, you will be introduced to Xcode, which is the IDE for Mac OS and iOS development. In the second part, you will take the opportunity to learn the basics of the Objective-C programming language and create a simple command line tool using Xcode.

**Reminder:** Please read the entire problem set before starting.

### Getting Started ###

Xcode is already installed on the iMacs in Programming Lab 1, so there is no need for you to install Xcode if you work in the lab. If you plan to work on this assignment and subsequent assignments on your own iMac or Macbook, you will have to install Xcode yourself. If so, we will leave you to figure out how to download and install Xcode.

This week’s assignment has two parts. The goal of the first part of the assignment is to create your first iPad application, HelloIPad. You do not have to worry, because you will be given detailed step-by-step instructions for this first assignment.

As the weeks go by, you will be required to be increasingly independent and figure out more things for yourself. Part of the learning experience is to learn how to figure things out even if you are not told explicitly what to do.

In the second part of this assignment, the goal is to get used to programming Objective-C. For this part, your goal is to develop a Mac command line tool. During this part, you will have to remember the C programming language (or learn C really quickly) and augment your knowledge with Objective-C syntax, constructs, and base classes

**Important Note:** Even though it is possible to complete the first part of the assignment just by following instructions, it is important for you to understand what you are doing in each step, since in the next assignments you will be required to use the same tools.

### Objective-C and Cocoa ###

Objective-C is the primary language that will be used to write Mac and iPhone/iPad software. During this semester, all coding assignments will be done using Objective-C. If you’re comfortable with basic object- oriented concepts and the C language, the extensions provided by Objective-C should be quite natural (though the syntax might seem a little odd) and it should be easy to pick up Objective-C during CS3217. More information and resources about Objective-C can be found on the Apple developer pages [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210).

Cocoa is Apple’s native object-oriented application programming interfaces (APIs) for the Mac OS X operat- ing system. For iPad programming, we will be using Cocoa Touch, a lightweight and touch-oriented API that provides the key frameworks for developing applications on devices running iOS. Similar to Cocoa, Cocoa Touch follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture. More information about Cocoa and Cocoa Touch is found on the Apple developer pages [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/).

Section 2 - Hello iPad!
--

In this assignment, you will use Xcode to create a project and storyboards to construct a very simple user interface. This assignment requires no coding. It is intended to provide you with a quick introduction to the tools that you’ll be using during the course. Follow this walkthrough and build your first **HelloIPad** application.

### Milestone 1: Create a new project in Xcode (Not graded) ###

Please follow the step-by-step instructions shown in Gallery 3.1 to create your first iPad app. The detailed instructions for each step is given by the caption below the figures.

TODO: Add screenshots

### Milestone 2: Run your project in the simulator (Not graded) ###

Please follow the step-by-step instructions shown in Gallery 3.2 to
run your first iPad app in the simulator. The detailed instructions for each step is given by the caption below the figures.

TOOD: Add screenshots

### Milestone 3: Understanding the Xcode IDE Layout (Not graded) ###

Interactive 3.1 shows the overall project layout in Xcode. Xcode is a powerful Integrated Design Environment (IDE).

TODO: Add screenshots

### Milestone 4: Add library interface elements to your app. (Not graded) ###

Please follow the step-by-step instructions shown in Gallery 3.3 to
add an interface element to the main view of your app. The detailed instructions for each step is given by the caption below the figures.

TODO: Add screenshots

### Milestone 5: Add resource files to your project. (Not graded) ###

Please follow the step-by-step instructions shown in Gallery 3.4 to add an image resource file to your project and add that resource into your app’s main view. The detailed instructions for each step is given by the caption below the figures.

Congratulations!

You have completed the first part of this assignment.

We have only shown you the basic functionalities of Xcode. You are strongly encouraged to explore Xcode 5 and other developer resources at the Apple Developer resources page (You may need to sign in with Apple ID to access these resources). In particular, you will find it useful to watch some of the videos from the past Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and the online iOS programming courses offered by Stanford on iTunes-U.
